# async-chat-server
Example asynchronous chat server in C++ using standalone Asio and TCP sockets.
- Uses C++20 and compiled with MSVC.
- Dependencies: 
    - Asio, http://think-async.com/Asio

- Attempts to keep lambda usage to a minimum (Too many tutorials out there were using huge, 20+ line lambdas which were difficult or impossible to debug and learn from).
